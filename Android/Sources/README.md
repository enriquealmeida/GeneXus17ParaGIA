Check out the [Deploy Changes Guide](DEPLOY_CHANGES.md) if you just want
 to make changes to the sources in the `Android\Sources` directory and
 see them deployed to your Genexus installation.

On the other hand, if you want to set up a development environment to
 build and contribute changes check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

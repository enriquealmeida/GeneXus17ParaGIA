<!--Auto-register anonymous user - How it works--><table class="TableWikiBody" id="tblwikibody"><tbody><tr><td><p>How is it possible to automatically register a user and keep it anonymous? In fact, what happens is that the application generated automatically creates a &quot;user&quot; of <a href="19888.html">GeneXus Access Manager</a> using the device identifier. The user created automatically has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is seen by the application as any other user. See <a href="19911.html">Auto-register anonymous user - SD usage example</a></li>
	<li>It is absolutely anonymous from the personal viewpoint. No personal data of the individual operating the device is known, requested or saved. </li>
	<li>It is possible to know the device identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>After having used the applications as an anonymous user, if the user decides to register in the application, GAM creates the new user (with the registration details) and assigns the same UserId that the auto-registered user had.</p>

<p>For GeneXus 15 upgrade 10 or previous, this happens only with <a href="21751.html">GAM Custom Authentication Type</a>, <a href="16512.html">GAM External Web Services Authentication Type</a> and <a href="20703.html">GAM Local Authentication Type</a>. SInce <a href="https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/wiki?38845,," target="_blank">GeneXus 15 Upgrade 11</a> it's valid for any <a href="16508.html">GAM Authentication Type</a>.</p>

<p>This allows for any information related to the auto-registered user saved by our application to remain associated to the new user registered.</p>

<p>How could the auto-registered anonymous user and the registered user be combined?</p>

<p>In the context of the <a href="19911.html">Auto-register anonymous user - SD usage example</a> consider the following case:</p>

<p>If the dashboard has <a href="https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/wiki?19912,," target="_blank">Auto-Register Anonymous User Property</a> = TRUE, and <a href="15214.html">Integrated Security Level property</a> = NONE, as shown in the figure:</p>

<p><img src="./images/19914.png" id="19914" class="WikiImage"/></p>

<p>This means that it is possible to access this dashboard without entering credentials, but the user cannot be auto-registered.</p>

<p>Note that the dashboard has an Action Item that is a SD panel called &quot;SubscribeNovel&quot;. Just like the dashboard calling it, it has the property Integrated Security Level = NONE:</p>

<p><img src="./images/19915.png" id="19915" class="WikiImage"/></p>

<p>This means that the behavior is the same as for the dashboard – this SD panel will be executed without request for login or auto-register.<br />
The REST service SubscribeToNovels is called from the SD panel object. Note in the image that Integrated Security Level = Authentication has been set in the procedure.</p>

<p><img src="./images/19916.png" id="19916" class="WikiImage"/></p>

<p>Therefore, when trying to execute this service, because it requires authentication and is in the tree of calls of a dashboard object that accepts the registry of anonymous users, an auto-registration will occur through the mechanism described.</p>

<p>Every smart device can be singularly identified by means of a DeviceId, which enables the GAM to automatically create a &quot;user&quot; for the device in a transparent manner. Such user will be identified by the device Id. This user is considered by the application as a registered user. Specifically, any data that the logic of the application associates to a user will be then associated to that user’s identifier that has been automatically created.</p>

<p>This user’s session never expires (meaning that the <a href="18577.html">Oauth token expire (minutes)</a> does not apply to the case of anonymous users’ sessions).<br />
When the user of the device decides to register (<a href="https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/wiki?19913,," target="_blank">GAM Registration</a>) using any of the methods available, the GAM will automatically relate the new user registered to the user created for the device, maintaining the user identifier. This prevents the application from having to make changes to the user-data relations it has already established.</p>

<p>Note: Until GeneXus 15 upgrade 10, the registration has to be done using the <a href="20703.html">GAM Local Authentication Type</a> to relate the registered user to the anonymous user.</p>

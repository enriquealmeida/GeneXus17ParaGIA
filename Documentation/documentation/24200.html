<!--Integration Scenario: No Database in the SD module: direct access to pre-existing system Database--><table class="TableWikiBody" id="tblwikibody"><tbody><tr><td><p>We have a <a href="24194.html">pre-existing web application</a> and need to develop a module for Smart Devices. The KB for the Smart Device application will not create its own database; instead, it will access the pre-existing system database.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./images/24197.jpg" id="24197" class="WikiImage"/></p>

<p>Several options are available to implement this access:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If the pre-existing system <u><strong>wasn’t</strong> developed using GeneXus</u>, or <u>we only have access to the database</u>, our only choice is to access the tables through a reverse engineering tool (DBRet) or manually through transactions and Data Views.</li>
	<li>If the pre-existing system was developed with GeneXus and we have access to its Knowledge Base, we can:
	<ul>
		<li>Similarly to the previous case, we can take the transactions of the pre-existing system which are relevant to the SD module, and create them in the new KB (for example, by exporting them from the pre-existing KB and importing them into the KB for SD) with associated DataViews to access the pre-existing database tables (both manually and through the reverse engineering tool).</li>
		<li>Migrate the pre-existing KB to Evolution 2 and create the SD module over that KB (creating parallel transactions and working with the original transactions).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="Advantages" class="HashLink" href="#Advantages">Advantages</a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Centralized data: There is no duplication of data; therefore, there's no need to worry about synchronization programs, maintenance, etc. In addition, when data is accessed from the SD application, the latest data is always returned.</li>
	<li>The pre-existing system doesn’t need to be changed: even if it was migrated before Evolution 2 for some other reason, there's no need to change anything in the pre-existing system. Accessing its database is enough.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Drawbacks" class="HashLink" href="#Drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>We can have problems mapping the data types of the pre-existing database (since it may not have been created with GeneXus, or it may have been created with an old version of GeneXus) and those handled by GeneXus X Evolution 2; for example, to manage images, videos, files.</li>
	<li>Impacts or changes to the structure of the pre-existing system database may cause the SD application to stop working.</li>
</ul>

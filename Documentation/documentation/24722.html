<!--Introduction to business process modeling based on the BPMN standard--><div class="TableWikiBody" id="tblwikibody"><p>The operation of a company involves carrying out proceedings and running processes, which are specific to the company's business.</p>

<p>The set of logically related tasks that are performed to achieve a business result is known as a <a href="48918.html">Business Process</a>.</p>

<p>Each one of the business processes runs in a certain order and to create a service or product. The administration of these business processes is called <a href="48919.html">BPM (Business Process Management)</a>.</p>

<p>The BPM methodology is focused on managing and continuously optimizing the business activities and processes within the organization, including management practices and policies, metrics and control processes, as well as the software tools that support all these activities. }</p>

<p><strong>Business Process Modeling Notation</strong> ( <a href="24915.html">BPMN</a>) is a standard graphical representation for modeling business processes in a workflow format.</p>

<p>BPMN was developed by Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) and is currently maintained by the Object Management Group since the two organizations merged in 2005. </p>

<p>GeneXus provides tools for modeling, managing and running business processes, such as the <a href="20259.html">Business Process Modeler</a> (as a standalone tool) and the <a href="16486.html">Business Process Diagram</a> object, which is integrated into the GeneXus development environment.</p>

<p>These tools are integrated in the <a href="43435.html">GeneXus BPM Suite</a></p>

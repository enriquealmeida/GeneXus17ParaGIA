<!--Integration and Evolution with GeneXus 17--><table class="TableWikiBody" id="tblwikibody"><tbody><tr><td><p>This is the era of the API economy, where business ecosystems are created based on the integration of services and digital products. Sytems need to connect, interoperate, evolve, multiply based on business needs, and this is not the exception, it's the rule. Creating and evolving those integrations that are continually changing is hard and takes time.</p>

<p>GeneXus 17 reduces the effort and the time and cost to integrate interoperating systems that evolve fast. </p>

<p>The key is modeling: Modeling APIs and an API mediation layer, modeling Business Processes, modeling for specific ecosystems and modeling Security globally and for every touchpoint with humans and systems.</p>

<h2><a id="API+Mediation" class="HashLink" href="#API+Mediation">API Mediation</a></h2>

<p>APIs are everywhere. When you need to be able to develop and expose APIs of your system, you need to maintain compatibility and you need to evolve those APIs, and these are two opposing forces. </p>

<p>To help you with this, GeneXus 17 introduces the <a href="46151.html">API object</a> which lets you model APIs and API mediation layers. Using this object, you declare its services and their interface, you declare its security level, you declare the implementation of each service, and as part of the mediation layer, you program data transformations required between interface and implementation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, through API objects, now you can easily know what APIs your Knowledge Base is exposing, a task that was not easy to do in previous versions.</p>

<p>So, by getting your knowledge modeled and formalized, you get higher productivity and flexibility to create and evolve your APIs.</p>

<h2><a id="Business+Process+Management" class="HashLink" href="#Business+Process+Management">Business Process Management</a></h2>

<p>Having used the <a href="43435.html">GeneXus BPM Suite</a> in the <a href='https://www.genexus.com/en/community/webinars/people-ideas-tools-what-is-behind-coronavirus-uy'>CoronavirusUy</a> project was key to get the required speed and agility that this project demanded. Modeling the workflow, changing it when the understanding of Covid-19 evolved and changes to the workflow or new flows were required, was what allowed that speed and flexibility.</p>

<p>This mission-critical project was, as one of many others run by GeneXus clients all over the world, proof of the power of the GeneXus BPM Suite. These projects also provided feedback on the latest improvements and were also input for others.</p>

<p>GeneXus 17 adds improvements in performance and scalability, improvements to the modeling of processes that start based on timers, and .NET Core support, among others.</p>

<p>An overview of all these can be found at <a href="46653.html">GeneXus 17 BPM Suite Release Notes</a>. </p>

<h2><br />
Security </h2>

<p>Systems gained enormous complexity (layers, internal and external APIs) and so many touchpoints (multi-experience).</p>

<p>To proactively manage the complexity from a security point of view, GeneXus 17 adds flexibility to <a href="24746.html">GeneXus Access Manager (GAM)</a>, adds new modules with functionalities related to cryptography, and updates the generated code and third-party libraries.</p>

<h3><a id="SAML+2.0" class="HashLink" href="#SAML+2.0">SAML 2.0</a></h3>

<p>Now your applications can authenticate users through any SAML 2.0 identity provider. This is a feature of GAM, so this configuration can be done at runtime. More information at <a href="https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/wiki?41212,," target="_blank">GAM SAML 2.0 Authentication type</a>.</p>

<p><img src="./images/46811.png" id="46811" class="WikiImage"/></p>

<h3><a id="Apple+Authentication" class="HashLink" href="#Apple+Authentication">Apple Authentication</a></h3>

<p>Every app on the App Store that handles authentication with third-party Identity Providers (Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc) must (as required by Apple) also support authentication through Apple ID. GeneXus 17 adds <a href="44478.html">GAM Apple Authentication type</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="WeChat+Authentication" class="HashLink" href="#WeChat+Authentication">WeChat Authentication</a></h3>

<p>In China, WeChat is used everywhere and everyone has a WeChat ID. GeneXus 17 adds <a href="45037.html">GAM WeChat Authentication type</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Biometric+Authentication" class="HashLink" href="#Biometric+Authentication">Biometric Authentication</a></h3>

<p>Taking advantage of the mobile device's capabilities, users can authenticate to your apps by biometry. You can configure this using the <a href="43466.html">Enable Biometrics property</a> when you use GAM.</p>

<h3><a id="Services+and+Interop" class="HashLink" href="#Services+and+Interop">Services and Interop</a></h3>

<p>New and more complex scenarios are supported to allow more secure communication and integration among systems. <a href="46492.html">Single Sign-on for Rest Services using GAM</a> has been added.</p>

<p>Also, GeneXus 17 adds <a href="43202.html">Security Token Service Client Authorization using GAM</a>  to centralize authentication and authorization of several applications.</p>

<h3><a id="Security+API" class="HashLink" href="#Security+API">Security API</a></h3>

<p>GeneXus 17 adds a set of modules that implement common functionalities associated with cryptography, digital signing, among others. More information at <a href="43916.html">GeneXus Security API</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Artificial+Intelligence" class="HashLink" href="#Artificial+Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a></h2>

<p>GeneXus 17 improves the integration with AI providers allowing the use of both, the power of the cloud, and the power of the Devices. It adds support for new providers and also new methods to support custom models, specifically image classification. </p>

<h3><a id="New+functionalities" class="HashLink" href="#New+functionalities">New functionalities</a></h3>

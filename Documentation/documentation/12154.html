<!--Help Generator Options--><table class="TableWikiBody" id="tblwikibody"><tbody><tr><td><h4><a id="Purpose" class="HashLink" href="#Purpose">Purpose</a></h4>

<p>Defines the available options when generating the application Help. The following options are common to CHM and HTML modes.</p>

<p><b>Language.</b>  It makes it possible to generate the Help file in the languages selected (in the Location node) or in all the languages of the KB.</p>

<p><b>Object Options. </b>It allows you to generate a help file for all the objects or only for those that were changed since the last time the Help was generated.</p>

<p><b>Include description as page title. </b>It includes the object’s description as the title of the HTML page generated for it.</p>

<p><b>Include CSS. </b>Name of a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file that is useful to change the format of the generated help file. A reference to this file is included in every HTML page generated.</p>

<p><b>Include Variables References.</b> In the object’s HTML, it includes a link to the HTML help page of each variable in this object (when help topics have been created for this variable).</p>

<p><b>Include Attributes/Domains References. </b>In the object’s HTML, it includes a link to the HTML help page of the attributes and domains referenced by this object (when help topics have been created for these attributes and domains).</p>

<p><b>Include Object References.</b> In the object’s HTML, it includes a link to the HTML help page of the other objects referenced by it (when help topics have been created for these objects).</p>

<h4><a id="Only+CHM" class="HashLink" href="#Only+CHM">Only CHM</a></h4>

<p><b>CHM Compiler Path.</b> This field is disabled when generating for the Web; it must be set to generate a CHM file; otherwise, it will not be possible to move forward in the application.</p>

<p><b>Include full-text search.</b> Besides the contents and the index, it enables the possibility to make searches in the CHM by generating a text search option in all the files that make up the help.</p>

<p><b>Custom main Html page. </b>The Page which is displayed when the CHM file is opened. A default page is provided, but it can be customized assigning the name of the custom page to this property.</p>

<p><b>Custom content path.</b> Like in the case of the default page, a contents file is also generated. The contents file defines a tree structure which allows organizing the items within the help.  In GeneXus, there is no way to indicate how the help items will be grouped. Thus, a rooted tree is generated by default, and all the help topics are placed bellow this root. The only embedded items are the variables with help. In this case, these items appear embedded under the help of the object where they are defined. This contents file can be edited with the HTML HELP Workshop and thus, a more organized and personalized tree will be obtained. If this file is saved with another name, it can be used in this option instead of generating the default file.</p>

<p><b>Custom index path.</b> It is like the contents file, but for the index definition file. In the event of the index file, the  HTML HELP Workshop can be used to sort the items in alphabetical order.</p>
